# Mule

Mule is an in-progress rewrite of the [AgOpenGPS](https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS)
project that aims to maximize the project's accessibility, including the UI, upgrading hardware
requirements from "Windows Laptop / Tablet" to
"Any mobile device running Windows / Linux / Android / iOS", etc.

# Plans

## Progress Towards Prototype

- [ ] Identify components of the original AOG software to rewrite
    - Active
- [ ] Manually program a UI using a provided mock-up as reference

## Progress towards Front-End Overhaul

- [X] Get Pinion into a working and usable state
- [ ] Get Crest into a working and usable state
    - [X] Finish writing the grammar for the parser
    - [ ] Develop an API for the parser that is easier to use than the one that's generated by
    the `pest` crate.
    - [ ] Implement standard CSS properties
    - [ ] Implement rust trait for applying style information to a struct that implements it
    - [ ] Implement pseudo-classes
    - [ ] Implement at-rules
- [ ] Get Peacock into a working and usable state (glue)
    - [ ] Design a standardized Widget trait for traits that implement it to be converted into
    an `iced` trait
    - [ ] Implement iced widget structs for standard HTML elements (Container, Row, Column, etc)
    - [ ] add a 3d-canvas widget
- [ ] Put together a mock UI design for Mule's interface
- [ ] Use Peacock to create the UI design for Mule (no 3d-renderer)
- [ ] Implement the functionality behind the UI in rust
- [ ] 

## Milestones

- [ ] Software prototype
- [ ] Front-end overhaul
- [ ] Hardware prototype
- [ ] Language files (for easy translations)
